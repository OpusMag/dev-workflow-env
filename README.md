config files for stuff

How to setup environment for ubuntu:

First you'll obviously have to install latest ubuntu version

Then, since audio is nice, you'll install 

Pulseaudio and pavucontrol

Then you'll install i3 and customize for tile window management:

Then i3lock-color to customize the lock screen

Then polybar to create a status bar and customize it

Then i3wm-themes to create a theme for your desktop (including wallpaper)

Then it's time to install lazyvim, which has a bunch of dependencies

The main ones are a nerd font, Luajit, lazygit and kitty.

Luajit info here: file:///home/magnus/luajit/doc/luajit.html

Then it's a good time to replace the default config files for your own. The necessary config files are in this repo.
